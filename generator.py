    """
    Generate a grounded answer from retrieved Cornell dining chunks.

    `retrieved_chunks` is the list returned by retrieve(). Each item is a dict:
      - "text"     : the chunk text
      - "article"  : the source/article name
      - "distance" : similarity score (you can use this to filter weak matches)

    Design points worth talking through with your group:
      - How will you format the chunks into a context block for the prompt?
      - What instructions will stop the model from answering beyond what the
        sources say? (Grounding is the whole point — a confident wrong answer
        is worse than an honest "I don't know.")
      - How will you surface which source each answer comes from?

    The response should:
      1. Answer using only the retrieved context — not the model's general knowledge
      2. Make clear which source the answer comes from
      3. Say so clearly when the answer isn't in the loaded dining sources

    Return the response as a plain string.

        "- The sources include ranked lists (e.g. a numbered \"best colleges for food\" "
        "list, where #1 is best) and tier ratings (S/A/B/C, where S is highest). When a "
        "question asks you to compare items, you MAY use these rankings or tiers as "

        "source. Draw that comparison and cite the specific ranks/tiers you used; this is "
        "grounded reasoning, not outside knowledge.\n"
        "- Keep in mind the excerpts may reflect a specific point in time (e.g. hours or "
        "whether a place is open), so present those details as coming from the source rather "
        "than as guaranteed current facts.\n"
        "- State which source your answer comes from.\n\n"
